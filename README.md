# 📖 Introduction

FileProcessorPro is a **production-ready Go application** that scans directories, calculates SHA256 hashes of files, and processes them concurrently using a **dynamic worker pool**.

It includes:

* **Live metrics reporting** (processed files, failed files, queue length, goroutines, memory usage)
* **Worker autoscaling** (adds workers automatically when the queue grows)
* **Graceful shutdown** via Ctrl+C or system signals
* **Error handling** and atomic counters for concurrency safety

This project demonstrates **real-world systems programming concepts** in Go.

# 🛠 What This Project Does

* Scans directories recursively for files
* Hashes files using SHA256
* Processes multiple files concurrently with **worker goroutines**
* Reports live metrics every second
* Dynamically adds workers if backlog grows
* Gracefully shuts down on **Ctrl+C** or termination signals

# ⚙ Functions Overview

| Function             | Purpose                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main()`             | Initializes workers, metrics reporter, autoscaler, walks directories            |
| `worker()`           | Processes jobs from the channel, computes SHA256, updates metrics               |
| `processFile()`      | Opens file, computes SHA256, simulates processing delay                         |
| `metricsReporter()`  | Prints live metrics every second (processed, failed, queue, goroutines, memory) |
| `workerAutoscaler()` | Dynamically adds workers if backlog grows, tracks logical reduction             |

# 💾 Installation / Setup

**Requirements:**

* Go >= 1.25
* Windows, Linux, or macOS

**Steps:**

1. Clone repo (or create project folder):

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd FileProcessor

```

2. Initialize Go modules (if not done):

```bash
go mod init fileprocessor

```

3. Build or run:

```bash
go run main.go -dir=C:\Users\YourUser\Documents -workers=4

```

**Optional build:**

```bash
go build -o fileprocessorpro main.go
./fileprocessorpro -dir=C:\Users\YourUser\Documents -workers=4

```

# 🏃 How to Use

* Run with `-dir` to specify directory
* Run with `-workers` to specify initial number of workers
* Monitor metrics printed every second
* Press **Ctrl+C** to gracefully stop

**Example:**

```bash
go run main.go -dir=C:\Windows -workers=4

```

# ⚠️ Cautions & Warnings

* The program reads **all files in the directory recursively** — do not point it to extremely large directories without enough RAM.
* SHA256 hashing can be CPU-intensive for very large files.
* Autoscaler increases workers dynamically — too many workers can overwhelm CPU.
* Only **files** are processed, directories are skipped.

# ✅ Advantages

* Handles large directories concurrently
* Real-time metrics for observability
* Dynamic adjustment of workers for performance
* Graceful shutdown prevents resource leaks
* Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

# ❌ Disadvantages

* High memory usage if queue size is huge
* Autoscaler currently **cannot reduce active workers forcibly**; idle workers exit naturally
* Metrics printing may slightly slow down very high-throughput processing
* No persistence of processed files metadata yet

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

* True **worker scaling down** (idle workers terminate automatically)
* Add **throughput stats** (files/sec)
* **Prometheus metrics** endpoint for external monitoring
* **Terminal dashboard UI**
* **Retry mechanism** for failed files
* **Distributed processing** with multiple machines
* **Configurable thresholds** for autoscaling

# ⚙ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Program starts, parses flags `-dir` and `-workers`
2. **Context** and graceful shutdown signal are initialized
3. Jobs channel with buffer 100 is created
4. Initial workers (`worker()` goroutines) start
5. **Worker autoscaler** starts monitoring the queue
6. **Metrics reporter** prints live metrics every second
7. Directory is walked recursively; files are sent to jobs channel
8. Workers read jobs, compute SHA256, update metrics
9. Autoscaler adds workers if backlog grows
10. Ctrl+C triggers context cancellation
11. Workers and metrics reporter exit gracefully
12. Final summary is printed
